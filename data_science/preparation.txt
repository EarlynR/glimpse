IDEA: 
Create an app that determines the ranking of caregivers based on satisfication
by a given cohort. Let's say a doctor is most popular among males ages 18-25, but least popular for females ages 70-85. 

This will help future patients get treated by the right doctor. 

Caveats: 
We need to find a way to help new doctors from getting off the ground. Would
like to conduct a multi-arm bandit algorithm or a recommendation system to 
allow that to happend. 

Experiment Design: 
A/B testing to check the new system. 
Multiarm bandit to check the new system. 

Questions: 
Min. number of doctors in a practice that is required for this to work?
Will it work for specialized doctors? 
Min. number of patients that you need to get enough data? 
Do you have to use PII (personally identifying information) in order for this to work?
-Can you tell with just age, insurance policy, gender?
What happens when your model is wrong? Do you have to catch that so that they don't see him more than once?
How long does it take for it to be up and running for a brand new practice? 
-Okay to say that this works well with general practices. 
What's the actual computational cost of this? Unfortunately, this requires info that I don't really know. Could say that it's really cheap. 
What do we do for patients who do not like any of their doctors?!
